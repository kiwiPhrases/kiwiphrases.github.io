# Introduction



# Race and unit quality

![raceAdequacy]

64% of renters in Milwaukee are white while 29% are black and 4% asian. If we were to assume that unit inadequacy is equally likely among all races then if I were to plot a bar chart of unit quality then I would expect the same pattern: 64% of whites having inadequate units and 29% of blacks having inadequate units. When we examine unit adequacy by race, we see largely consistent patterns whereby 65% of whites, 28% of blacks, and 4% of asians have adequate units. However, the uniformity ends there. When we look at the moderately and severely inadequate bars, the share of whites decreases substantially. Namely, among the moderately inadequate units, 37% are occupied by blacks, 6% occupied by asians while 55% are occupied by whites. It becomes slightly more distorted in the Severely Inadequate units where only 48% of occupied by whites while 37% are occupied by blacks and 16% by a household with indigenous roots. Is this surprising?

One would expect lower levels of adequacy among cheaper units and since there is a high correlation between blacks and lower socio-economic attainment, it is possible that in the above plot, we simply confounded race with socio-economic status. One quick way to check that is to simply plot rents against adequacy and race - as I do below.

# Discussion

Now, I am not suggesting that landlords renting to minorities are deliberately not maintaining their units out of spite or discrimination. There are countless alternative explanations that could lead to our observations. For example, since Milwaukee is a rather segregated city, it could be that some landlords sort into serving minority households but since these units also tend to be cheaper, the landlords who will sort into such neighborhoods will likely have less equity and professional experience in property management so that landlords serving minority households are both less equipped and capable of maintaining adequate units.  

Note that I drop RV, motorboard and other home types. Additionally, to simplify the discussion, any households that had an Alaskan or Indian label in their race was labeled as indigenous and mixed households (ie white-black or white-asian) were dropped.
